# Use this website as a template for your academic research group

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and  [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to re-use it for your purpose. 

This website is inspired and inherited from the template by [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/) at Leiden University. We really appreciate them providing this awesome template that relieves us from re-inventing wheels and web dev heavy works.

### Getting started
All pages are written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for easy editing, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) uses Liquid for the data-driven pages. The publicaion list, news items, and group members are stored as `.yml` data sheets (plain text) in the `_data folder`, so that one can update the website easily. The pages are in the `_pages` folder. Updating and maintaining is easy using [Github](http://www.github.com) (not worldpress-easy, but there are other advantages (see e.g. [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/), or [this](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/11/jekyll-against-the-rest-of-the-world/)). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) takes all the markdown and data files, and creates beautiful `html` files in the `_site` folder.

If you never used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), read the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) article and check out [their website](https://jekyllrb.com). Same for [Github](http://www.github.com), which will host your first website draft. 

Create and open a github account, go to [our repository](https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab), and click 'fork'. This is now your copy of the website, and you can change and adapt it as you want. You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it). Then change the name of the repository to "your_username" and the name of the branch to "gh-pages".  Your website is now automatically published under *your_username.github.io/your_username/*. Except that it probably still looks like our website. 

To modify the webpage, you can either do everything on on github.com (go to a file, click "edit", then "commit", "push"), or install  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on your computer and play with your local copy that you sync with the branch on github.com.  The former is much easier in the beginning, but a bit less convenient once you start rewriting everythint. To get it to work on your computer (and to learn a bit more about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)), [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) and [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme) are tutorials on how to use it and how set it up locally. Also, consider using the [Github desktop app](http://www.desktop.github.com), I found it helpful.
